LET'S USE THIS FILE TO WRITE COMMENTS ABOUT THE EDITING PROCESS

1. This folder has the main text which is in writeup1 word file. 
   Ignore the pages file. I used it to make the draft as I prefer Mac's spell check.

2. I do not have a citation manager, so maybe at the end I will export 
    everything to latex and make the submission version.

3. The writeup is arranged as follows: 
    Introduction, Results, Discussion, Methods, Figure Captions, Supplemetary Experiments

4. The figure, data, model, etc. are all given in the folder figuresAndData

5. Let me know if you have questions. I am going to work on the 
    Supplementary Experiments section now.
